## Our Responsibilities

35

​

36

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable

37

behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in

38

response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

39

​

40

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or

41

reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions

42

that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or

43

permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,

44

threatening, offensive, or harmful.

46

## Scope

47

​

48

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces

49

when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of

50

representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail

51

address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed

52

representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be

53

further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

​

55

## Enforcement

56

​

57

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be

58

reported by contacting the project team at Grp-opensourceoffice@adobe.com. All

59

complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that

60

is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is

61

obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.

62

Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

63

​

64

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good

65

faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other

66

members of the project's leadership.
